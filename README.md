# 1. Spotify Clone
    This project is a Spotify clone created using only HTML and CSS. It replicates the core layout and visual elements of the Spotify web player, including a sidebar for navigation with options like Home, Search, and Your Library, along with an interactive music player at the bottom of the screen. The design features a clean, dark theme with various sections showcasing recently played tracks, trending music, and featured charts. The music player includes essential controls like play, pause, volume adjustment, and track progress. This project demonstrates proficiency in responsive web design, flexbox, and modern CSS techniques to create an appealing user interface.
